## üìù Description
This is a back end application for a Social Network created using a configured working Express API & mongoose ODM to interact with a mongoDB database. MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with larger amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. Due to their prevalence, the aim of this application is to demonstrate my understanding of how to build and structure the API of these networks.

<a name="usage"></a>
## üñ• Usage 
This application allows you to navigate different link routes that display data from the database. 

- GET/ POST routes: <br>
    `http://localhost:3001/api/users` <br>
    `http://localhost:3001/api/thoughts`<br>

     - If you wish to <u>GET</u> a certain id you can do so by adding an `/id` at the end of the link. 

- PUT/DELETE routes: <br>
    `http://localhost:3001/api/users/:id`<br>
    `http://localhost:3001/api/thoughts/:id` <br>

- POST/ DELETE routes: <br>
    `http://localhost:3001/api/users/:id/friends/:friendId` <br>
    `http://localhost:3001/api/thoughts/:id/reactions` <br>

    - The route above is used to <u>POST</u> a new reaction. If you wish to <u>DELETE</u> a certain  reaction you can do so by adding an `/id` at the end of the link. 

You can set these routes up and run tests using [insomnia](https://docs.insomnia.rest/).
